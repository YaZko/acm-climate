\section{Data Analysis: Locations}

\subsection{How Carbon Efficient Were These Conferences?}

Present the results using a couple of metrics

\subsection{How Did the Conferences Do in Attracting Local Participants?}

Show 1st quartile and median distances

\subsection{Were There Geographic Differences Between the Four Conferences?}

POPL/ICFP (Europe-centered) vs PLDI/SPLASH (NA-centered)

\subsection{What Would Have Been the Ideal Locations for Each Conference?}

Try to do this in Google Earth. Caveat: this is a non-linear system, because the participants depend partly on the location... so that needs to be accounted for.
