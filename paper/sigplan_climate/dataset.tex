\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

Our dataset consists of 10 years of registration records for the four major
SIGPLAN conference series---POPL, PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH---from the
beginning of 2009 until the end of 2018. Data for a few of the conferences
in the earlier years is missing. In total, we have data for 33 conferences,
corresponding to 8,758 unique participants and 16,374 trips. For each
participant, we know all the conferences they attended and from which city
they departed to attend the conferences.

Before we started working with the data, the names of participants were
replaced in the dataset by unique hashes, obscuring each individual's
identity while allowing them to be identified across years and across the
conferences they attended.
