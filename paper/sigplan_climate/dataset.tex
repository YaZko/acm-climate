\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}
 
Our dataset consists of 10 years worth of attendance to the four major
SIGPLAN conference series---POPL, PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH---from the
beginning of 2009 until the end of 2018. Data for some of the conferences in the
earlier years are missing. In total, we have data for 33 conferences,
corresponding to 8,758 unique participants and 16,374 trips. For each
participant, we know all the conferences (s)he attended, and from which city
(s)he departed to attend the conferences.
%
The names of participants are replaced in the dataset by unique hashes,
obscuring each individual's identity while allowing them to be identified
across years and across the conferences they attended.
