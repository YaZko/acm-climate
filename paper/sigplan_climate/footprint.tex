\section{The footprint of conferences: an estimation}

Carbon footprint is the essential metric of interest that we seek to reduce.
As such, it is also the starting point of our analysis.
We introduce in this section the methodology we used and tool we built to
conduct all of our analyses, and describe the first results ran on our dataset.

\subsection{Evaluation of the carbon cost: methodology}
\label{sec:methodo}

We conduct all our analyses through a \python{} script, publicly available at
\url{https://github.com/YaZko/acm-climate}. We describe its behavior and give
a brief overview of its use in Section~\ref{sec:software}.
\bcp{Maybe this repo needs a more
informative name?}

For the carbon footprint estimate we present in this paper,
it is relevant to keep in mind the following assumptions that have
been made:
\begin{itemize}
\item we assume that \emph{all} participant travelled by plane;
\item we assume that the airports used are close enough to the end points for their locations to be assimilated;
\item we assume that all flights are direct flights;
\item we assume that the geodesic distance is the one taken by planes.
\end{itemize}

Estimating the errors introduced by these hypotheses and refining them would be
a valuable work. However, for this first proposal that mainly aims at a relative
evaluation of different structural changes in our activities, we believe those
to be workable hypotheses.

Remains now to convert this distance to an emission in \gaz. We use to this end
a standard model introduced as part of the \texttt{DEFRA 16} report on
Greenhouse gas
\footnote{\url{https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2016}}
\footnote{\url{https://co2calculator.acm.org/methodology.pdf}}
conducted by the British Government.

The model distinguishes three classes of flight, depending on their length:
short, medium or long hauls. Each category is associated with a linear
coefficient relating directly the distance of travel to the amount of \gaz
emitted. We make the assumptions, anecdotally observed, that researchers all
fly in economy class.

A second linear coefficient, identical for all flights and so-called
\emph{radiative forcing index}, is added to account for the difference in
radiative forcing between the same emissions at ground level compared to high in
the atmosphere. This coefficient has been taken for the results presented in this
paper to be $1.891$ as suggested by R. Sausen et al.~\cite{Sausen05}

We therefore obtain the following piece-wise linear model of emissions for a flight covering $d$ kms:
\begin{itemize}
\item $1.891 * 0.14735 * d$ \gazunit if $d < 785$
\item $1.891 * 0.08728 * d$ \gazunit if $785 \leq d < 3700$
\item $1.891 * 0.077610 * d$ \gazunit if $3700\leq d  $
\end{itemize}

%% It should be noted that experiments with other models show significant variance
%% in absolute value, but resilience in relative values.\bcp{Maybe worth
%%   showing some numbers justifying these statements?}\yz{I agree, will
%%   do}\bcp{Assuming that we can get our numbers to agree with CoolEffect's,
%%   we could also mention this!} Once again, refining the
%% model would hence be a valuable work, but using this simple standard and
%% well-established one appears appropriate to draw conclusion in terms of
%% \emph{relative} impact of different measures.

%% This first pass of the script therefore give us an estimation of the footprint
%% of our conferences. We have implemented on top of it several analyses aiming to
%% estimate the correlation some concrete factors upon which conference organizers
%% can act may have with this footprint.
%% The description of these analyses will cover Section~\ref{sec:community} to \ref{sec:speculate}.

\subsection{Footprint of the studied conferences}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|}
  \hline%
  \bfseries Event & \bfseries Location & \bfseries \# Participants & \bfseries Total cost & \bfseries Average cost 
\csvreader[head to column names]{../../output/sigplan/footprint_confs.csv}{}%
{\\\conf\ \year & \location & \csvcoliv & \csvcolv & \csvcolvi}%
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{For each \event: location, number of participants and carbon cost, total and average per participant, in \gazunitbis,}
\label{table:footprint}
\end{table}

We now turn to the estimation of the footprint of our dataset.
Table~\ref{table:footprint} depicts the total and average carbon cost per participant of
all conferences analyzed. This cost is estimated in terms of \gazunitbis of emissions.
The main data of interest is arguably the last column depicting the average cost per participant.

This high level data already suggests an interesting observation:
\begin{obs}
If the carbon footprint of conferences due to air travel is indeed significant,
its specific average value per participant varies from an \event to another by up
to a factor of 2.
\label{obs:footprint}
\end{obs}

Indeed, the lowest average carbon cost of our dataset is obtained by PLDI'18 at 0.9\gazunitbis,
while the highest one is reached by ICFP'16 at 1.93\gazunitbis.
Understanding the underlying rationals for such variations may be a promising
angle to reduce our emissions without restructuring fundamentally our activity.
