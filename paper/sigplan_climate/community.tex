\section{Data Analysis: Community}
\label{sec:community}

The amount of greenhouse emissions reached by a specific \event is in direct proportion with
the average distance traveled by the participants of this \event.
We therefore propose various analyzes aiming to estimate the nature of the
communities that animate each conferences. These secondary metrics are
intended to suggest to conference organizers possible ways to reduce the
main metric of interest: the carbon footprint. 

The aggregated information we derive falls into two main categories.
First, the demographic distribution of the participants to the conferences
conditioned by various factors.
Second, the participation habits of the community through recurring participation
to a given conference, and overlap in participation between several conferences.

%% Through this section, we present the results of our data analysis in a
%% neutral way. We point out phenomena that came out as a
%% surprise to us, but defer opinionated observations and practical conclusions to
%% Section~\ref{sec:opinions}.

\subsection{Demographics}
\label{subsec:demo}

\begin{figure}
  \csvautotabular{../../output/sigplan/demographic.csv}
  \caption{For each \event, continent in which it took place and distribution of
    each continent by origin of participants. The final column indicates the
    portion of participants that traveled from the same continent the
    conference took place in.}
  \label{fig:demo-raw}
\end{figure}

Demographic data are a key resource to understand the carbon cost of attendance.
Figure~\ref{fig:demo-raw} shows, for each \event, the
continent it took place in, the distribution of attendance per continent, and
the percentage of attendants originating from the same continent as the one it
took place in. To a first approximation, maximizing this last parameter is a fair
heuristic to minimize the carbon cost without any impact on the organization of
the conference itself. One may already notice that in the current conjecture, in
sheer question of volume, attendance is essentially divided between Europe and
North America primarily, Asia secondarily.

\begin{figure}
  \csvautotabular{../../output/sigplan/demographic_per_conf.csv}
\caption{For each kind of conference, distribution of participants per continent of origin}
\label{fig:demo-conf}
\end{figure}

A natural idea suggested by the desire to increase the percentage of attendance
taking place locally at the scale of continents is to look for a core group of
recurrent attendees that would constitutes a model of the distribution of the
attendees of a given conference. To investigate this idea, Figure~\ref{fig:demo-conf}
depicts an aggregated information of the previous data: for each 
\conf, the average distribution of attendance per continent. From this
table, one can observe the relative cultural anchor of each conference into a
specific continent. Most notably, PLDI and SPLASH appear to be very North
American-centric, while ICFP's core community seems to have a quite strong
anchor in Europe as well.

This aggregation of data however intrinsically rests upon the assumption of a uniform
community attending each conference every year. A closer inspection of
Figure~\ref{fig:demo-raw} easily convinces us of the erroneous dimension of this
hypothesis. Most strikingly, Asian participation during POPL '15, ICFP '11 and
ICFP '16, events that took place on the Asian continent, is significantly higher
than usual: there appears to be a strong locality phenomenon. Crossing the data with
Figure~\ref{fig:demo-conf} one can also notice that the only time SPLASH took
place in Europe turned out to be the least expensive edition, challenging our previous
observation that the conference appears to be mostly north American-centric.

\begin{figure}
  \csvautotabular{../../output/sigplan/demographic_delta.csv}
\caption{Geographical distribution of participation conditioned by the location of the \event}
\label{fig:local_effect}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:local_effect} attempts to measure this locality effect. The
table depicts, all conferences being considered at once, the geographical
distribution of attendance conditioned by the geographical location of the
\event. The Asian phenomenon previously hinted at is here extremely
apparent: while overall on average, 10.9\% of the participants come from Asia,
this number is roughly multiplied by a factor 4 when the \event takes place in Asia --
without any significant drop in total volume of attendance that could indirectly bump
the percentage.

But interestingly, this phenomenon also exists in the case of Europe (+22.29\%
deviation to the average) and North America (+12.15\% deviation to the average).
Despite their name, international conferences appear to exhibit a fairly strong
local component.

\subsection{Attendance overlaps}
\label{subsec:overlap}

Section~\ref{subsec:demo}, through the study of the demographic distribution of
attendance, has suggested the existence of local communities that only
partake in conferences when they take place close to their place of residency.
One can conversely look for groups of regular attendees, that participate to a given \conf
regardless of the location it is held in.

     \caption{For any two years, percentage of overlap in attendance at the corresponding editions of a conference (part 2)}
     \label{fig:overlap-conf-beta}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:overlap-conf-alpha}~and~\ref{fig:overlap-conf-beta} present one
way to gather intuition about the reality and size of this phenomenon. For a
given conference at a time, we depicts, for any pair of years, the percentage of
attendees that participated in both events. In particular for two consecutive
years, this number oscillate between 15\% and 30\%. The vast majority of
participants of a conference were therefore not part of the previous edition.

\yz{TODO: This data is not striking enough and takes a lot of space. To aggregate
  more, or ditch in favor of the following tables only}\bcp{IMO it is worth
  keeping.  But maybe it could be moved later?}

  \label{fig:overlap-cross}
\end{figure}

Arguably more useful for practical purposes is to evaluate the overlap 
between the events for the same year of two different conferences.
Figure~\ref{fig:overlap-cross} depicts this data for any pairing of the four
conferences considered. The overlap is strikingly low for most conferences.

  respect to \emph{unique} participants.  \bcp{I really like this table.}}

\end{figure}

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:reccurent} and \ref{fig:old-timers} offer two different views on reccurent participations. Figure~\ref{fig:reccurent} represents respectively for the whole dataset and for each conference individually the average number of editions an average participant has been part of, as well as the percentage of participants that has been part of at least some amount of times. We immediately remark that no less than 75\% of unique participants has been part of a single edition.
Figure~\ref{fig:old-timers} represents for each instance of each conference the percentage of participants that has participated in a previous instance of the conference, among our dataset.
