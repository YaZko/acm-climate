\section{What-If Scenarios}

In our report~\cite{climate_report}, we mentioned that another approach to addressing climate issues is to rethink the conference culture that has emerged, organically over many decades, in SIGPLAN (and computer science generally) and consider more radical changes to it. We then list a few alternatives. This section presents a forecast of carbon footprint for three of those alternatives, based on the attendance data we have. \emph{Again, we need to make a lot of assumptions and explain them, because this is not a linear system...}
