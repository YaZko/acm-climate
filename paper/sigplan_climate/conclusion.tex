\section{Conclusion}

We advocate for carbon footprint to be a central constraint driving the logistic
choices made during the organization of a conference. As such, we have conducted an
analysis over the participation to the past SIGPLAN conferences, drawing both an
estimate of their carbon footprint, and various correlation between the
geographical distribution of its attendees and this footprint.

%% \ifopinions
%% Our main intent with this analysis is to trigger debates and actions with the intent
%% to reduce this footprint.
%% We however already actively advocate for such analyzes to
%% become the norm, as well as for multi-localized conferences to be experimented with.

We believe that the experiment we conducted in this paper should be generalized.
To help march toward this goal, as well as to trigger debates over the right way
to conduct these analyzes, we developed a reusable, open source tool allowing
one to conduct similar experiments without having to go through their own
development cycle.
