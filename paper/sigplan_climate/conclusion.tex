\section{Conclusion}

Carbon footprint is becoming a significant consideration for conference
organizers. To support effective decision-making, we have conducted an
analysis of the participation for several SIGPLAN conferences, drawing both
an estimate of their carbon footprint and various correlations between the
geographical distribution of its attendees and this footprint.

%% \ifopinions
%% Our main intent with this analysis is to trigger debates and actions with the intent
%% to reduce this footprint.
%% We however already actively advocate for such analyzes to
%% become the norm, as well as for multi-localized conferences to be experimented with.

We believe that the experiment we conducted in this paper should be
generalized.  To help move toward this goal, as well as to trigger debates
over the right way to conduct these analyses, we developed a reusable, open
source tool allowing others to easily conduct similar experiments.
