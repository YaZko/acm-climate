\section{Introduction}

Facing the threat of global warming, it is morally incumbent on every
individual and organization to evaluate the carbon emissions footprint
generated by their activities and consider ways to reduce them.  For many
academic researchers, this footprint will overwhelmingly come from air
travel, especially to international conferences.

With this perspective in mind, we may be attracted to ponder several questions
about our activity. Should SIGPLAN conference locations be chosen to minimize
their carbon impact? Should we move toward co-locating more conferences? Or on
the contrary, should some conferences be split into two remote sites?
More drastically, should some conferences be held entirely virtually?
% \bcp{This is a
%   good question, of course, but I'm not sure it is addressed at all by the
%   data we have.}
% \yz{My rationale was that all these questions require hard numbers to ponder
%   correctly, which is the object of this paper. None of these questions should
%   really find an answer here, should it?}

Such decisions have various impacts on our activity, and may have drawbacks in
terms of the social and professional benefits of conferences. 
In order to ground discussions about the compromises we wish to collectively undertake, we consider
three main classes of data whose analysis may guide the decisions of the community.
\begin{itemize}
\item What has been the emissions of past conferences?
\item What is the geographical distribution of participants to conferences?
\item What is the overlapping in participation that exists between various conferences?
\end{itemize}

We propose in this paper one such analysis that we hope can be seen as a basis both for
debates about concrete measures, as well as the basis for more involved data analyses.
We describe the results of this study applied to the SIGPLAN conferences, and describe
the open source tool we developed to this end, advocating for its use by other communities.

After describing briefly our dataset in Section~\ref{sec:dataset}, we present an
estimate of the SIGPLAN conferences' footprint in Section~\ref{sec:footprint}.
Section~\ref{sec:community} contains the central part of our analysis: we derive
several statistics about the geographical distribution of the participants and
their habits of cross participation, across time and across conferences, arguing
that these data are correlated to the footprint.
We then present in Section~\ref{sec:speculate} a speculative experiment aiming
to estimate the ideal locations for the conferences in order to minimize the
footprint.

We draw in Section~\ref{sec:opinions} concrete recommendation to the SIGPLAN
conference organizers based on this analyzes.

Finally, we advertise for the use of the open source tool we developed to
conduct our analyzes in Section~\ref{sec:software}, hoping that other
communities might piggyback on our effort to conduct similar studies.
